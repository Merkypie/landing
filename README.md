# Landing Page Exercise

As per requested

##Requirement Explanations

1. Simple Slider/Carousel | Json Feed
 * I've combined requirements 1 and 5 into one objective. If needed, I can change requirement 5 back to the list.
2. Tab Section
 * I was unsure if I was allowed to use the jQuery UI -- and since it tends to be bloated, I simply just went the hard way.
3. Sticky Menu
 * I decided to use the simplest and most literal approach for this. Links do not work.
4. Responsive YouTube Embed
 * The Youtube video is responsive though the aspect ratio is something that I couldn't really control unless whipping up some Javascript.
5. One Element Enhancement
 * The page uses some CSS3 animations to fade things in and out. It also is responsive and there is a fake 'mobile' menu option. I might go back in and actually make it a fully functional menu.
6. Lorem ipsum dolor...
 * NEEDS MOAR LOREM IPSUM

## Other Thoughts

There was more things I was thinking of doing but not enough time to do so with the current
work schedule but hopefully this can convey my general method of madness.
